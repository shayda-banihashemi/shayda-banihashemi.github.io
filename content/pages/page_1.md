I.	INTRODUCTION

The introduction of the public cloud created numerous new information technology solutions and capabilities. The advanced method of deploying these solutions is known as the continuous integration / continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline and is used to streamline the process of implementing hardware and software solutions in the public cloud. The CI/CD pipeline is a framework that includes different stages to perform the continuous integration and continuous delivery tasks. Each stage operates by using different tools to create the aggregate pipeline. Continuous integration includes the ongoing coding, building and testing tasks. Continuous delivery is the process of releasing new changes and deploying to production. Cloud solutions that are implemented using the CI/CD pipeline are gaining more traction throughout the Information Technology (IT) community around the world. It’s a solution with unique options and various benefits. It does, however, include many complexities in its implementation, utilization, and ongoing maintenance. There are many challenges to consider in deciding if this solution is the right one to implement. Organizations need to research and answer a series of questions before deciding whether to proceed with this complicated framework. Those are questions are as follows:
1.	What are the reasons an organization would want to deploy cloud solutions using CI/CD?
2.	Who are the various cloud providers and what services do they offer?
3.	What are the CI/CD stages and the corresponding products that should be researched and tested?
4.	How does the public cloud and the CI/CD pipeline impact IT administrators?
5.	What are the security challenges of running IT operations in the public cloud using the CI/CD pipeline?
6.	What best practices, policies and compliance requirements need to be included?
7.	When should the public cloud and CI/CD pipeline be used?
8.	What can be learned from other organizations that made this change?

Following these deliberations, a strategy should be developed to keep the organization focused on its endeavor. All of these considerations will help contribute to the success of the organization’s IT tasks and goals. Throughout this research, each of these issues will be analyzed to determine whether the complexities associated with deploying solutions in the public cloud through the CI/CD pipeline are justified or if they are too complex to be successfully implemented.
