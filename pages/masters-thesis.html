    <h1>Cloud and CI/CD Challenges</h1>
<p>I.  INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The introduction of the public cloud created numerous new information technology solutions and capabilities. The advanced method of deploying these solutions is known as the continuous integration / continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline and is used to streamline the process of implementing hardware and software solutions in the public cloud. The CI/CD pipeline is a framework that includes different stages to perform the continuous integration and continuous delivery tasks. Each stage operates by using different tools to create the aggregate pipeline. Continuous integration includes the ongoing coding, building and testing tasks. Continuous delivery is the process of releasing new changes and deploying to production. Cloud solutions that are implemented using the CI/CD pipeline are gaining more traction throughout the Information Technology (IT) community around the world. It’s a solution with unique options and various benefits. It does, however, include many complexities in its implementation, utilization, and ongoing maintenance. There are many challenges to consider in deciding if this solution is the right one to implement. Organizations need to research and answer a series of questions before deciding whether to proceed with this complicated framework. Those are questions are as follows:
1.  What are the reasons an organization would want to deploy cloud solutions using CI/CD?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Who are the various cloud providers and what services do they offer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the CI/CD stages and the corresponding products that should be researched and tested?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the public cloud and the CI/CD pipeline impact IT administrators?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the security challenges of running IT operations in the public cloud using the CI/CD pipeline?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What best practices, policies and compliance requirements need to be included?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When should the public cloud and CI/CD pipeline be used?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What can be learned from other organizations that made this change?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Following these deliberations, a strategy should be developed to keep the organization focused on its endeavor. All of these considerations will help contribute to the success of the organization’s IT tasks and goals. Throughout this research, each of these issues will be analyzed to determine whether the complexities associated with deploying solutions in the public cloud through the CI/CD pipeline are justified or if they are too complex to be successfully implemented.  </p>
<p>II. CONVENTIONAL IT OPERATIONS </p>
<p>Understanding how traditional IT teams operate within organizations as it relates to existing solutions, processes, and procedures can illustrate why so many organizations are moving to the cloud. Many organizations operate by having separate teams manage engineering and operational tasks based on various technologies. For example, server teams provide physical or virtual capabilities with various operating systems like Unix or Windows. The network team offers a variety of solutions like switching, routing and firewall capabilities based on internal and external customer needs, as well as load balancing options and more. The storage team provides solutions like Storage Area Network (SAN), Network Attached Storage (NAS) and Object Unstructured Data Storage for different workloads and their corresponding performance needs. The security team provides services like Identity Access Management (IAM), as well as vulnerability scanning and patching. Development teams are also a huge cornerstone of IT departments that can build out company specific applications without purchasing Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) software solutions. These are just a few of the teams that most robust IT departments are likely to maintain. Each of these teams work with their management and business partners to understand their business needs. Based on that information, they begin to formulate plans and strategies to build and implement solutions. 
Infrastructure engineering teams often start by researching products offered by several different vendors and compare and contrast the capabilities advertised. They then make a selection from one of those options and run that system through a multitude of tasks in a test environment. This would include building out test cases for hardware systems or software programs based on the requirements that were previously gathered. Typically, functional tests would be done to make sure the required features operate as they are advertised. In the event that they are not working as they should, or that the team runs into a bug, feedback is provided to vendors so improvements and enhancements can be made. Engineers also need to run a series of performance tests that validate the vendor claims on various speed related metrics like Input Output Operations (IOPs), throughput, latency, and central processing unit (CPU) utilization. Those are followed up by high availability tests to check the resiliency and scalability of the system to make sure it can meet the demands of the workload. Once these respective engineering teams complete these tests, they need to make a decision to move forward with an investment or look for another product that would be a better fit and start the process again. 
At this stage, it’s common for conversations between the infrastructure, vendor, and vendor management teams to take place regarding the cost of the products and services, including support and maintenance. The next step would be to begin the installation in pre-production and production environments by making a series of requests to other teams. A data center location needs to be provided, IP addresses and DNS names need to be reserved, and port assignments and configurations need to be made. The engineers need to create a detailed cabling spreadsheet for onsite resources to follow in order to accurately run cables. This is a particularly important step that could have major consequences when events like code upgrades are done or maintenance is performed. If power and switching are not drawn to two independent and redundant sides, the system will not be highly available resulting in an extended outage that can have impacts on productivity, revenue, as well as the company brand. The next step of the implementation process is to configure the systems to prepare them for the workloads that will be migrated onto them. These tasks require the collaboration of resources across multiple teams, as well as project managers to make sure that tasks are completed on schedule in order to meet project deadlines. This process can become very resource intensive. 
After the initial engineering implementation steps are complete, operations teams take over support of day-to-day tasks like provisioning requests, monitoring the health of the systems, responding to alerts, maintaining security, managing code upgrades and analyzing capacity. The operations resources often spend a good amount of time with developers understanding their requirements for changes to existing applications, as well as the new applications that need to be deployed in the environment. The operations engineers need to understand the workload the applications will generate to right size the infrastructure needed to support the applications and provision the solution within a reasonable amount of time. If the latter cannot be done in an appropriate amount of time, the operations team risks becoming a bottleneck for the organization - stunting potential growth. 
A developer’s tasks usually starts with the steps outlined in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). They meet with their business partners to understand their application requirements and begin their project work with the design phase. In a pre-procured dedicated sandbox environment, they begin developing their code and creating test cases. Team members collaborate with one another throughout the development process to craft the best solution possible. Several levels of user acceptance testing (UAT) with various participants are completed to test the code for functionality. They then work with the operations team to deploy the first version of code into production. Feedback is provided by testers and business partners so that enhancements to the code and application can be made to offer additional capabilities to end users. This process can take weeks to months to complete. These are the typical teams, roles and responsibilities that make up major IT departments found in the largest companies in the world. While this may be how many of them operate now, it is debatable if this is the best way to run and function in the future.</p>
<p>III. CI/CD &amp; CLOUD JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>IT has always been in a state of change. Organizations have had to learn to adapt to changes and the teams that manage the solutions have also had to do the same.  When the right technology and methodologies are put to use, new products and services can be delivered to the market on an expedited schedule. If companies don’t take the opportunity to innovate their solutions, processes, and procedures, they often end up running their IT departments in an unproductive manner. Employees end up spending excessive amounts of time working on repeatable tasks that can and should be automated. These organizations are also slow to embrace changes that can put them in direct contact with the most cutting-edge IT solutions like those that are available in the public cloud. Companies that avoid looking towards the future often get stuck in the here and now restricting their ability to grow stronger and more profitable businesses. 
Operating the IT environment in this way keeps companies on legacy systems that are difficult to maintain because of the reduced vendor support. Staffing becomes a problem too since there are less resources to manage these aging systems (Mitchell). In order for individual resources and IT departments to avoid becoming stagnant in their roles and offerings, they must be capable of change. If they fail to do so, they will start to see their profits drop, they will most likely lose a percentage of the market share and in extreme situations, the organization could go out of business. With the incredible number of products and services offered to IT professionals in the market, employees must challenge the status quo within their teams in order to bring real change and value to the organizations that they support. Implementing solutions in the public cloud through the CI/CD pipeline allows organizations to do things bigger, better and faster. It helps organizations stay current with emerging technology. There are plenty of solutions and options to choose from in the cloud as well as the CI/CD pipeline which can be configured into custom solutions to be used by any organization. The solutions offer many different opportunities to automate, expedite deployments and scale solutions to provide enhanced and new products and services. This helps keep the company relevant and profitable. </p>
